#  Movie Ticket Price

## Overview

A local movie theater has a unique pricing strategy depending on a viewer's age. You are tasked to write a program that prompts the user for their age and then informs them of the cost of their movie ticket.

## Requirements

1. Prompt the user to input their age.
2. Based on the age provided, display the ticket price according to the following rules:
   - If the age is less than or equal to 3, the ticket is free.
   - If the age is between 4 and 12 (inclusive), the ticket price is ₱10.
   - If the age is between 13 and 59 (inclusive), the ticket price is ₱15.
   - For anyone 60 or older, the ticket price is $12.
3. Ensure the program accounts for unexpected inputs (e.g., negative age values, non-numeric values).

## Evaluation Criteria

1. Correctness: Does the program correctly determine and display the ticket price for all age categories?
2. Error Handling: Does the program handle unexpected or invalid inputs?
3. Code Clarity: Is the code easy to understand and well-commented?
4. Efficiency: Is the code free of unnecessary redundancies or repetitions?
